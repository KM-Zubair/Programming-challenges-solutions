Background Story: I happened to know some mind reading tricks with numbers, where I ask someone to guess a number and then I tell them to do some calculations and in the end I tell them the answer without having any clue of what numbers they guessed. And I also know another trick where a tell someone to guess two numbers, then they do some calculations as my instruction and later they tell me the answer, with that I can tell what were the two number they guessed. So, I just converted my two mind reading tricks into code and it became a mind reading game. 

Game Description: To maintain the flow of the game, first I ask the user his/her name so I can mention their names in the game to make them more comfortable with it. Then I acknowledge them about the game that, he/she will get to guess numbers and I will ask them to do some simple calculations and later on, I will either tell them the numbers they guessed or the answer they just got. So they get to choose according to their desire. Every maneuver they perform is interconnected with other task and there’s not a single place where the code gets repeated. The user gets a decent pause between each sentence to read the instructions carefully and think about it. In the end I surprise them by guessing the correct number and that’s pretty much how it works.
